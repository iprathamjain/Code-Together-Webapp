# Code Along
It is a live code sharing platform built using Node.js, Express, React, and Socket.io. Users can join different rooms and code together with their partners and compile their code in C++/Python/Java. I am currently trying to implement audio chat feature in it. It is deployed at https://codealong-frontend.herokuapp.com/
